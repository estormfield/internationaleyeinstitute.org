          Maj StormoGipson, Pediatrician and founding member of IEI, was dedicated to bringing medical care to rural
          populations of Latin America. In the years following her passing in 2013, her children, Kenna, Kate, and Luke
          have
          created the Maj StormoGipson Scholarship Fund (&quot;Maj Fund&quot;) to honor her spirit and continue her
          legacy of caring. The
          Maj Fund is available to local Guatemalans of rural Lago Atitlan through a partnership with Hospitalito in
          Santiago
          Atitlan, one of several locations where IEI works. By providing this educational opportunity, we can help
          empower
          local residents to become healthcare providers in their own community, while also enhancing the medical care
          provided
          at Hospitalito.
        </p>

          There is a critical and ongoing need for indigenous medical providers who can offer care in local Mayan
          languages,
          and who will stay long-term in their rural communities. However, they need help with the cost of their
          education. The
          Guatemalan government does not offer student loans and for most local families the cost of advanced education
          is out
          of reach.
        </p>

          <strong> Your contribution will help provide educational opportunities to those who have the least access and
            yet are the
            most in need. </strong>

          Our first scholarship recipient is Pedro Abraham Mendoza Yaqui (pictured below with his grandmother). A young
          man from
          Santiago Atitlan, Pedro's dream was a career in health sciences. Without the support of the Maj Fund, he would
          not be
          able to pursue his studies in Biological Chemistry to become Lab Director for Hospitalito. One day, the hope
          is that by
          having its own Lab Director, Hospitalito will be able to
          <img style="float: right; height: 250px; margin:15px; margin-top: 15px" src="images/pedro-with-mother.png"
            alt="Pedro with mother">
          maintain its own blood bank, which the local community desperately needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the scholarship fund, Pedro will be completing his first year of studies in December 2018! And in
          four more
          years he will become the first local resident to be Lab Director of Hospitalito.
        </p>
        <p>Pedro ªs studies cost $4,500 per semester which includes tuition, fees, supplies, room and board. <strong>We
            need
            your help
            to make sure Pedro can continue next year. </strong> So far we are $1,600 toward our goal of $9,000 for the
          year.
          Even $25,
          $50, or $100 will help!</p>
        <p>In May of 2018, during a medical service trip to Guatemala, Justin StormoGipson was able to sit down with
          Pedro for
          a short interview. </p>
