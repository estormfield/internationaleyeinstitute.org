        <h2>Story #1</h2>
        <p>
            A tragic accident at 10 while learning to farm corn alongside his older brother stole Samuel&#39;s
            vision in one eye. His brother&#39;s machete accidentally struck him, causing a rare type of
            traumatic cataract. Blind for nine years, a four-hour journey at 19 led him to us. We cleared the
            scar tissue, implanted a sulcus lens, and gifted him back the sight he&#39;d lost.

        <h2>Story #2</h2>
        <p>Our youngest patient was Guillermo at age 7 with bilateral congenital cataracts and 20/100
            vision. His dad works in the mountains in agriculture. When we entered the operating room he
            jumped up on the table and then held the anesthesia mask in place while he was put to sleep.
            While restoring Pedro&#39;s vision in both eyes brought immense satisfaction, the true joy came in
            the form of Nerds Clusters. After explaining his post-op care, Josh (Dr. Dance’s amazing
            assistant) presented him with a bag, and the pure excitement in Pedro&#39;s eyes almost rivaled his
            newfound sight!.</p>

        <h2>Story #3</h2>
        <p>A surgical team led by Dr. Dave Dance recently returned from another mission trip to
            Guatemala, where they performed surgeries and provided training to local doctors at
            Hospitalito Atitlan in Santiago Atitlan. Among their patients were two brothers, Dolmar and
            Kilver, who live in extreme poverty at the bottom of a steep ravine near a river of “agua
            negra” - sewage. When Dr. Dance offered them a bag of granola for breakfast, he
            lightheartedly joked about making up for the meal they missed on the day of their surgery.
            However, he soon realized that missed meals might be a regular occurrence for Dolmar and
            Kilver. Both brothers were born with congenital cataracts, and one of each of their eyes was
            treated during last year&#39;s mission trip by Dr. Pulin Shah. Vicenta, a social worker at
            Hospitalito, located the brothers and informed them of the possibility of getting their other
            eye fixed. With Dr. Dance&#39;s team, they were able to finish the work Dr. Shah started and
            they both left excited to have clear vision restored in both eyes.</p>

        <h2>Story #4</h2>
        <p>Pedro works helping people carry their goods to market…well, worked in the market until 2
            years ago he lost vision in his right eye. Then last year lost vision in his only remaining eye.

            There was pride in his voice as he described his work and sorrow as he described how his
            vision slowly drifted from shapes, to shadows, to nothing and how he could no longer navigate
            his town. We took both of his cataracts out during the week.  He’s excited to get back to work in
            a few weeks.   He reminds us that we should be grateful every day we get to go to work..</p>

        <h2>Story #5</h2>
        <p>Blanca, a 40-year-old mother of nine, has spent the past year living in a half-lit world. Her
            youngest child, still nursing, has a face she hasn&#39;t seen in over twelve months. An old
            inflammation left her blind in one eye, and scar tissue had all but sealed shut the pupil of the
            other. Yet, a sliver of hope remained: she could still tell light from dark.
            Dr. Jessen, a skilled surgeon with a gentle touch, took on the challenge. He meticulously peeled
            away the scar tissue, freeing Blanca&#39;s iris like a sculptor unveiling a hidden masterpiece. Then,
            with practiced precision, he removed the cataract and implanted a new lens, restoring the
            missing piece of her vision. She was absolutely beaming with joy at the prospect of seeing
            again, our hearts yearned to capture the moment when she saw her baby&#39;s face for the first
            time.</p>
