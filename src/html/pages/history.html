              height="179" class="fltright-img" />Since graduating from medical school my wife, Maj, and I have
            enjoyed going to third-world countries and delivering much needed medical care.  </p>
          <p>Before specializing (ophthalmology for me and pediatrics for Maj) we were general practice doctors for
            2 years in Jinotega, Nicaragua.</p>
          <p>That experience has inspired us to return with a medical team almost every year since we finished our
            residencies in 1991.  We have worked in Mexico, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.  </p>
          <p>Over the years, we have introduced many fellow colleagues from the U.S. to third-world medicine.  Many
            people in the U.S. have the desire to use their medical training to help in developing countries, but
            they have a hard time finding a situation where they can apply their skills. It has been very fulfilling
            to lead trips and give people the opportunity to contribute.  </p>
          <p>Why do we think this work is so important and why do we spend so much time, money, and energy on
            leading these trips?  </p>
          <p>First of all, there are the obvious needs our patients have.  Restoring and improving visual function
            is important in any society.  For poor people in third-world countries, their survival depends on it.  
          </p>
          <p>However, just as important is the reverse mission aspect of these trips. During our two years in
            Jinotega, Nicaragua we learned how we can use our medical knowledge to impact a small town, and more
            importantly, how that small town can impact us and our communities back in the United States.  </p>
          <p>We have come to realize that the relationships that come from our interactions with patients in the
            third-world influences us as much as it does the patients. When we return home, our experiences
            influence our communities. </p>
          <p>We truly believe that this reverse mission may, in the long run, be the most important result of our
            medical mission trips.</p>
