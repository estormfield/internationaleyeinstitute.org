      <h2>Maj StormoGipson Scholarship Fund</h2>

              Maj StormoGipson, Pediatrician and founding member of IEI, was dedicated to bringing medical care to rural
              populations of Latin America. In the years following her passing in 2013, her children, Kenna, Kate, and Luke have
              created the Maj StormoGipson Scholarship Fund (“Maj Fund”) to honor her spirit and continue her legacy of caring. The
              Maj Fund is available to local Guatemalans of rural Lago Atitlan through a partnership with Hospitalito in Santiago
              Atitlan, one of several locations where IEI works. By providing this educational opportunity, we can help empower
              local residents to become healthcare providers in their own community, while also enhancing the medical care provided
              at Hospitalito.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a critical and ongoing need for indigenous medical providers who can offer care in local Mayan languages,
              and who will stay long-term in their rural communities. However, they need help with the cost of their education. The
              Guatemalan government does not offer student loans and for most local families the cost of advanced education is out
              of reach.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong> Your contribution will help provide educational opportunities to those who have the least access and yet are the
              most in need. </strong>
            </p>

                Our first scholarship recipient is Pedro Abraham Mendoza Yaqui (pictured below with his grandmother). A young man from
                Santiago Atitlan, Pedro’s dream was a career in health sciences. Without the support of the Maj Fund, he would not be
                able to pursue his studies in Biological Chemistry to become Lab Director for Hospitalito. One day, the hope is that by
                having its own Lab Director, Hospitalito will be able to
                <img style="float: right; height: 250px; margin:15px; margin-top: 15px" src="images/pedro-with-mother.png" alt="Pedro with mother">
                 maintain its own blood bank, which the local community desperately needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks to the scholarship fund, Pedro will be completing his first year of studies in December 2018! And in four more
                years he will become the first local resident to be Lab Director of Hospitalito.
            </p>
            <p>Pedroʻs studies cost $4,500 per semester which includes tuition, fees, supplies, room and board. <strong>We need
                your help
                to make sure Pedro can continue next year. </strong> So far we are $1,600 toward our goal of $9,000 for the year.
              Even $25,
              $50, or $100 will help!</p>
            <p>In May of 2018, during a medical service trip to Guatemala, Justin StormoGipson was able to sit down with Pedro for
              a short interview. </p>
