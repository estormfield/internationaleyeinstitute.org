          <p><img src="images/Justin-and-Maj-in-Guatemala.jpg" alt="Drs. Maj and Justin StormoGipson" width="250" height="179" class="fltright-img" />Since  graduating from medical school my wife, Maj, and I have enjoyed going  to third-world countries and delivering much needed medical care.   </p>
          <p>Before specializing (ophthalmology for me and pediatrics for Maj) we  were general practice doctors for 2 years in Jinotega, Nicaragua.</p>
          <p>That experience has  inspired us to return with a medical team almost every year since we  finished our residencies in 1991.  We have worked in Mexico,  Guatemala, and Nicaragua.  </p>
          <p>Over the years, we have introduced many  fellow colleagues from the U.S. to third-world medicine.  Many people in  the U.S. have the desire to use their medical training to help in  developing countries, but they have a hard time finding a situation  where they can apply their skills. It has been very fulfilling to lead  trips and give people the opportunity to contribute.  </p>
          <p>Why  do we think this work is so important and why do we spend so much time,  money, and energy on leading these trips?  </p>
<p>First of all, there are the  obvious needs our patients have.  Restoring and improving visual  function is important in any society.  For poor people in third-world  countries, their survival depends on it.  </p>
          <p>However, just as important is  the reverse mission aspect of these trips. During our two years in  Jinotega, Nicaragua we learned how we can use our medical knowledge to  impact a small town, and more importantly, how that small town can  impact us and our communities back in the United States.  </p>
          <p>We have come  to realize that the relationships that come from our interactions with  patients in the third-world influences us as much as it does the  patients. When we return home, our experiences influence our  communities. </p>
          <p>We truly believe that this reverse mission may, in the long  run, be the most important result of our medical mission trips.</p>
