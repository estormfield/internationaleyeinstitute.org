                                        class="fltright-img" />Since graduating from medical school my wife, Maj, and I
                                    have enjoyed going to third-world countries and delivering much needed medical
                                    care. </p>
                                <p>Before specializing (ophthalmology for me and pediatrics for Maj) we were general
                                    practice doctors for 2 years in Jinotega, Nicaragua.</p>
                                <p>That experience has inspired us to return with a medical team almost every year since
                                    we finished our residencies in 1991.  We have worked in Mexico, Guatemala, and
                                    Nicaragua.  </p>
                                <p>Over the years, we have introduced many fellow colleagues from the U.S. to
                                    third-world medicine.  Many people in the U.S. have the desire to use their medical
                                    training to help in developing countries, but they have a hard time finding a
                                    situation where they can apply their skills. It has been very fulfilling to lead
                                    trips and give people the opportunity to contribute.  </p>
                                <p>Why do we think this work is so important and why do we spend so much time, money,
                                    and energy on leading these trips?  </p>
                                <p>First of all, there are the obvious needs our patients have.  Restoring and improving
                                    visual function is important in any society.  For poor people in third-world
                                    countries, their survival depends on it.  </p>
                                <p>However, just as important is the reverse mission aspect of these trips. During our
                                    two years in Jinotega, Nicaragua we learned how we can use our medical knowledge to
                                    impact a small town, and more importantly, how that small town can impact us and our
                                    communities back in the United States.  </p>
                                <p>We have come to realize that the relationships that come from our interactions with
                                    patients in the third-world influences us as much as it does the patients. When we
                                    return home, our experiences influence our communities.</p>
                                <p>We truly believe that this reverse mission may, in the long run, be the most
                                    important result of our medical mission trips.</p>
